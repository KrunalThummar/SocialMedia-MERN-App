Utilizing React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB I have built a Full Stack MERN Application - beginning to end. The Application is classified as "Memories" and a basic social media app, which is purely for learning application that permits clients to post fascinating things that occurred in their lives.

Furthermore, Remember to install node_modules in your code to run.
